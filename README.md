# BloodFlowPrediction
## 1. Introduction
In standard long-axis cine MR views the intensity fluctuations within the blood pool provide a visual clue about the global blood flow pattern within the cardiac cavities.      In this project, we proposed a deep learning based method for automated intra-cardiac blood flow velocity prediction from standard long-axis Cine MRI.
